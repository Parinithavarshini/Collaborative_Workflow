# Collaborative GitHub Workflow

## Description
This project involves setting up a collaborative GitHub workflow for a team-based repository. It focuses on Git-based practices like branching strategies, pull requests, code reviews, and merge conflict handling.

## Git Workflow

### 1. **Branching Strategy**
- Use a **feature branch** for each new feature or task.
- Branch off from `main` and name your branch according to the feature (e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`).

### 2. **Committing Changes**
- Commit often with meaningful messages.
- Use the following format for commit messages:  
  `git commit -m "Add: [feature/task description]"`.

### 3. **Pushing Changes**
- Push your branch to GitHub:  
  `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.

### 4. **Creating a Pull Request**
- Once your feature is complete and pushed to GitHub, create a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to `main`.
- In the PR, describe the changes made and why they are necessary.
- After team review and approval, the PR can be merged.

### 5. **Merge Conflicts**
- If there are merge conflicts, resolve them by manually editing the conflicted files.
- After resolving, commit the changes and push them.

## Contributing

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork to your local machine:  
   `git clone <your-fork-url>`.
3. **Create a new branch**:  
   `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.
4. **Make changes**, commit, and push to your feature branch.
5. **Open a Pull Request** to the main repository's `main` branch.
